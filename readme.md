üó∫Ô∏è Map Charts
===
A web application which shows a map with charts overlaid on top.
---
A simple geographic data visualization example.

This application is built with HTML and JavaScript, using the D3.js rendering library.

### Current Term Goals (January 8th 2022)
‚úì Renders a D3.js map of the United States  
‚úì (Map Prototype) Map rendering is within a javascript function which injects the map into a given element  
‚úì The render function can move the viewport to specified lat/long coordinates  
‚úì The render function takes in lat/long coordinates and renders red points at those positions  
‚úì (Map Display) Map rendering is within a javascript object which manages a map and can update the view properties and data
‚úì Mock data is added  
Rendered data is clustered into a single datapoint in the middle of the group when zoomed out (points are close together in the view)
The red points are replaced with charts representing the data  
Styling is at a presentable quality  
Ensure performance with 1-40 charts, even on mobile devices  

### Files
map-prototype.js  
This file contains the initial prototype; it has the barest logic required to render a map with data graphed on top in an SVG.
map-renderer.js  
This file contains the final solution; it has an optimized map handler which allows for zooming and panning the view.

Optimization approach - hide svg and render on a canvas instead, then use hidden svg to test mouse collisions: https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/d3-round-two-how-blend-html5-canvas-svg-speed-up-rendering
