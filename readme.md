### Current Term Goals (January 8th 2022)
‚úì Renders a D3.js map of the United States  
‚úì Map rendering is within a javascript function which injects the map into a given element  
‚úì The render function can move the viewport to specified lat/long coordinates  
‚úì The render function takes in lat/long coordinates and renders red points at those positions  
‚úì Mock data is added  
The red points are replaced with charts representing the data  
Styling is at a presentable quality  
Ensure performance with 1-40 charts, even on mobile devices
